# `frontend/` - The SvelteKit Frontend

SvelteKit application that communicates with ICP canisters via the Internet Computer Agent.

## Core Philosophy

**Backend-agnostic design:** The frontend communicates through typed actors generated from Candid interfaces. This ensures type safety and clean separation.

## Structure

- **`routes/`**: File-based routing. Each folder = a route.
- **`lib/`**: Reusable components, utilities, and the actor initialization.
- **`static/`**: Unprocessed assets (fonts, global CSS, favicon).
- **`app.html`**: The HTML shell.

## The ICP Bridge (`lib/actor.ts`)

**Critical file** for canister communication:
- Initializes `HttpAgent` with proper network config
- Creates typed actor from generated Candid bindings
- Handles local vs. mainnet differences
- Fetches root key in development

## Best Practices

1. **Modular Pages**: Separate logic (`[name].ts`) from UI (`+page.svelte`)
2. **Use Stores**: For shared state across components
3. **Type Safety**: Import types from `declarations/backend/backend.did`
4. **Error Handling**: Always wrap actor calls in try/catch
5. **Loading States**: Show feedback during async operations

## Environment Variables

Injected by `vite-plugin-environment`:
- `CANISTER_ID_BACKEND` - Backend canister ID
- `DFX_NETWORK` - Current network (local/ic)

## Development

```bash
npm run dev    # Vite dev server (HMR enabled)
npm run build  # Production build to dist/
```
